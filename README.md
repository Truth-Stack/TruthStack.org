## 🛡️ The Mission
In the 2026 information landscape, the cost of verifying reality has become an **Innovation Tax**. Truth Stack is a decentralized protocol designed to decouple information discovery (**Layer 1**) from mathematical verification (**Layer 3**).

We are building a **Fortress of Math** to protect the digital commons from synthetic misinformation, algorithmic rents, and model collapse.

### 🏗️ Strategic Pillars
* **Spatial Integrity:** Providing "Ground Truth" for spatial intelligence and world models to prevent perceptual poisoning.
* **Non-Extractive Utility:** Replacing algorithmic rent-seeking with a verifiable digital commons.
* **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI):** Creating sovereign, open-source frameworks for global information governance.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Three-Layer Cleave
Truth Stack operates on a modular hierarchy to ensure speed without sacrificing integrity:

1. **Layer 1 (Discovery):** Real-time ingestion of raw data streams (Social, Sensor, and Web).
2. **Layer 2 (Refinement):** Statistical filtering and noise reduction via community-audited logic.
3. **Layer 3 (Verification):** **The Fortress.** Cryptographic anchoring and peer-attestation using the `did:truthstack` standard.

## 🏛️ Join the Hall of Pillars
We are seeking researchers, engineers, and civic leaders to help audit and anchor the protocol.

1. **Verify the Anchor:** Check the Genesis Signature at [TruthStack.org](https://www.truthstack.org).
2. **Audit the Core:** Review our L3 verification logic in the `/core` directory.
3. **Submit Attestation:** Contribute to the verification pool to earn your place on the global leaderboard.

## 🔐 Integrity & Security
* **Security:** Please report vulnerabilities via encrypted channel to `security@truthstack.org`.
* **Governance:** This project is licensed under **Apache 2.0** to ensure it remains a global public good.
* **Identity:** Our root identity is anchored at `did:truthstack:genesis`. Accept no substitutes.
