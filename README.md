# TRUTH STACK PROTOCOL (v1.0)
> "No one can own knowledge. It belongs to everyone. No one can own discovery. It is only experienced. And imagination is freedom."
> — **The Founder's Note**

## The Mission
To prevent AI from becoming a "Gilded Cage," the Truth Stack provides a universal architecture for categorizing information. We move away from the "Black Box" of monolithic AI and toward a transparent, three-tiered reality.

### The Architecture
1. **L1: THE FORTRESS (Deterministic)**
- **Role:** Verifiable Ground Truth.
- **Mechanism:** Mathematical proof, formal verification, and immutable records.
- **Value:** Trust.

2. **L2: THE LABORATORY (Probabilistic)**
- **Role:** Empirical Filtering.
- **Mechanism:** Bayesian inference, peer-review nodes, and cross-referencing.
- **Value:** Clarity.

3. **L3: AI DREAMS (Generative)**
- **Role:** Infinite Potentiality.
- **Mechanism:** Unconstrained neural weights and generative imagination.
- **Value:** Freedom.

## Open Standards & Compute
We invite infrastructure providers, researchers, and AI sovereigns to adopt this stack. By labeling outputs with these layers, we restore the social contract between Carbon and Silicon.
